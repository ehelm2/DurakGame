# DurakGame
Final project: A card game that can be played on the command line (with future capability to play on a GUI!)

# General Information
Durak means 'Idiot!' in Russian. A player is the durak if they lose all of their cards. The game is set up with a 36-card deck of playing cards (all cards above 6, and Ace is the highest). A card is pulled from the deck that is called the trump card. The suit of this card trumps cards of other suits. The player with the lowest card with the trump suit goes first.
